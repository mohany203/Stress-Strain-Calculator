# Stress-Strain-Calculator
This MATLAB project calculates normal and shear stresses, principal stresses, and their rotation angles. It takes inputs for normal stresses, shear stress, and rotation angle, and visualizes results using Mohr's Circle. The output includes stress values and a Mohr's Circle plot for stress transformation.
